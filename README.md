# 30 days of code
 
A project where I challenge myself to code every day for 30 days.

## Want to join the challenge?

1. Create a copy of this repository
2. Change styles.css to fit your own style
3. Change the title tag to display your name
4. Add new challenges for yourself! (Optional)

That's it! If you decide to do this too, please don't remove any of the content in the footer. You're free to mess with everything else.
